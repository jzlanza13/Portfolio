In this portfolio, you will see example code intended to demonstrate my software skills.  I love to write software, but more so, I love using software to meet a need of a client or business.

These limited files come from an application where customers can claim sales to earn reward points and then redeem reward points.  I cannot share all of the files due to NDA restrictions, and 100% of the code is custom to the client's needs.

Please reach out if you have any questions.
